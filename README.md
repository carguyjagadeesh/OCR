## Problem Statement  
Implementing machine learning models for Optimal character Recognition our solution leverages machinelearning to automate accurate detection and monitoring of enhancing early diagonsis and intervention for improved



## About the Project  
In this project, the main objective is to check whether the person is having Diabetic Mellitus or Not.To predict the case whether or not we will be using feature like age, Glucose levels, Blood pressure etc.  


## Technical Stack  
HTML
PYTHON
CSS


## Implementation
+ At early stage we will be collecting the information of the subject on Glucose levels, BMI, skin thickness, inslin level, blood pressure.
+ Then we will run through linear regression model and get the prdiction

## Installation & Run
+ Clone this repository and unzip it.
+ After downloading, cd into the Diabetic directory.
+ Begin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it.
+ Install the required packages using ~pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ Execute the command: python app.py

## Future
We can still work on the accuracy and also the number of features considered should be increased and use better deep learning algorithms.
