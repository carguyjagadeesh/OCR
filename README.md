## Installation & Run
+ Clone this repository and unzip it.
+ After downloading, cd into the OCRapp directory.
+ Begin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it.
+ Install the required packages using ~pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ Execute the command: python app.py

## Future
We can still work on the accuracy and also the number of features considered should be increased and use better deep learning algorithms.
