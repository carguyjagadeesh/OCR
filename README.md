## Problem Statement  
Implementing machine learning models for Optimal character Recognition our solution leverages machinelearning to automate accurate detection and monitoring of enhancing early diagonsis and intervention for improved

## Technical Stack  
HTML
PYTHON
CSS

## Installation & Run
+ Clone this repository and unzip it.
+ After downloading, cd into the Diabetic directory.
+ Begin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it.
+ Install the required packages using ~pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ Execute the command: python app.py

## Future
We can still work on the accuracy and also the number of features considered should be increased and use better deep learning algorithms.
